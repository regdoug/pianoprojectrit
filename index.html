          <h3>Stay Tuned for Project Updates! </h3>
          <p>The project is simple: take an upright piano we received and turn it into a player piano.
          In the old days, it would have been very difficult to do something like this, but with modern electronics and a little ingenuity, a few hard working engineering students can get it done during what little spare time that they have.</p>
          <p>We have grand plans for this piano, but right now we are in the earliest planning stages.
          Follow our updates here as we first add 88 solenoids to the inside of the piano and then write software to make our piano come alive!</p>
